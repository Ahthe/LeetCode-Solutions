Given an array of integers `numbers` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

Return the indices (**1-indexed**) of two numbers, `[index1, index2]`, such that they add up to a given target number `target` and `index1 < index2`. 

Note that `index1` and `index2` cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

There will always be **exactly one valid solution**.

Your solution must use O(1) additional space.

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: numbers = [1,2,3,4], target = 3

Output: [1,2]
```

Explanation:

The sum of 1 and 2 is 3. Since we are assuming a 1-indexed array, `index1` = 1, `index2` = 2. We return `[1, 2]`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 1000`
- `1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `1000 <= target <= 1000`

## Solution

Time Complexity: O(n)  

Space Complexity: O(1)  

```python
'''
The Two Pointers algorithm involves using two indices to traverse the array from both ends towards the center. 
In this solution, we use two pointers to find two numbers that sum up to the target. 
By adjusting the pointers based on the current sum, we efficiently find the solution in O(n) time complexity.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        # Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the list
        leftPointer, rightPointer = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        
        # Loop until the two pointers meet
        while leftPointer < rightPointer:
            
            # Calculate the current sum of the numbers at the two pointers
            currentSum = numbers[leftPointer] + numbers[rightPointer]
            
            # If the current sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer left
            if currentSum > target:
                rightPointer -= 1
            
            # If the current sum is less than the target, move the left pointer right
            elif currentSum < target:
                leftPointer += 1
            
            # If the current sum equals the target, return the 1-indexed positions
            else:
                return [leftPointer + 1, rightPointer + 1]
        
        # Return an empty list if no solution is found (though the problem guarantees a solution)
        return []
```

## Notes

- **Initialization**:
    - You start with one pointer (`leftPointer`) at the beginning and another pointer (`rightPointer`) at the end of the array. This setup lets you shrink the problem space by either moving the left pointer to the right or the right pointer to the left.
- **Sum Comparison**:
    - You compute the sum of the numbers at the two pointers. If the sum is larger than the target, you move the `rightPointer` to the left (to decrease the sum, since the array is sorted). If the sum is smaller, you move the `leftPointer` to the right (to increase the sum).
- **Termination**:
    - When the two pointers meet, you either find the solution or conclude there is none. Since the problem guarantees a solution, you will find the correct pair and return their indices.
- **Efficiency**:
    - This approach runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the length of the array, as each pointer moves inward exactly once.
- **Why Use Two Pointers?**
    - The **Two Pointers** technique is useful when dealing with problems where you can efficiently traverse from both ends of a sorted array or list to achieve optimal time complexity. Here's why it works well in problems like **palindrome checking** or **two-sum** in a sorted array

## Example Walkthrough

Let’s consider an example with the input `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`.

1. **Initialization**:
    - `leftPointer = 0` (points to `2`)
    - `rightPointer = 3` (points to `15`)
2. **First Iteration**:
    - `currentSum = numbers[leftPointer] + numbers[rightPointer] = 2 + 15 = 17`
    - Since `currentSum > target`, move the `rightPointer` left: `rightPointer = 2`
3. **Second Iteration**:
    - `currentSum = numbers[leftPointer] + numbers[rightPointer] = 2 + 11 = 13`
    - Again, `currentSum > target`, move the `rightPointer` left: `rightPointer = 1`
4. **Third Iteration**:
    - `currentSum = numbers[leftPointer] + numbers[rightPointer] = 2 + 7 = 9`
    - Now, `currentSum == target`, so return `[leftPointer + 1, rightPointer + 1] = [1, 2]`.

This solution finds the target sum efficiently in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1) space**, satisfying both constraints.

## Edge Cases

- **Single Pair**: If the array contains only two elements, e.g., `numbers = [1, 2]`, the solution should handle this trivially.
- **No Solution**: The problem guarantees a solution, so this scenario won’t occur in valid inputs.
- **Negative Numbers**: Ensure the solution handles negative numbers correctly, e.g., `numbers = [-3, 2, 5, 10]`, `target = 7`.
- **Duplicates**: If the array has duplicate numbers, the solution should still return the correct unique pair, e.g., `numbers = [2, 2, 7, 11]`, `target = 9`.
- **Target as Sum of Extremes**: Test cases where the sum is formed by the smallest and largest elements, e.g., `numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `target = 10`.
