# [383. Ransom Note (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/description/)

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

## **Example 1:**

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false

## **Example 2:**

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false

## **Example 3:**

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

## **Constraints:**

    1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 105
    ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:

        # firstly we need to construct a counter for each letter in the hashmap

        # 3 ways to do this: 
        # 1st way
        counter = defaultdict(int)
        for c in magazine:
            counter[c] += 1

        # 2nd way for interview
        counter = {}
        for c in magazine:
            if c in counter:
                counter[c] += 1
            else:
                counter[c] = 1
        
        # 3rd way
        counter = Counter(magazine)

        # we to check if we can construct the ransomnote
        for c in ransomNote:
            if c not in counter:
                return False
            elif counter[c] == 1:
                del counter[c]
            else:
                counter[c] -= 1
        
        return True

        # Time: O(m + n)
        # Space: O(1)

```
## **Visualization**
```python
def canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine):
    # Initial state:
    # ransomNote = "aa"
    # magazine = "aab"
    counter = {}

    # --- First Loop: Building the Counter from Magazine ---
    for c in magazine:  # magazine = "aab"
        
        # --- Iteration 1 ---
        # c = 'a'
        if c in counter:  # Is 'a' in counter? No
            counter[c] += 1
        else:
            counter[c] = 1  # counter = {'a': 1}
        
        # --- Iteration 2 ---
        # c = 'a'
        if c in counter:  # Is 'a' in counter? Yes
            counter[c] += 1  # counter = {'a': 2}
        else:
            counter[c] = 1
        
        # --- Iteration 3 ---
        # c = 'b'
        if c in counter:  # Is 'b' in counter? No
            counter[c] += 1
        else:
            counter[c] = 1  # counter = {'a': 2, 'b': 1}

    # After first loop state:
    # counter = {'a': 2, 'b': 1}

    # --- Second Loop: Checking RansomNote Construction ---
    for c in ransomNote:  # ransomNote = "aa"
        
        # --- Iteration 1 ---
        # c = 'a'
        if c not in counter:  # Is 'a' not in counter? False
            return False
        elif counter[c] == 1:  # Is counter['a'] == 1? No (it's 2)
            del counter[c]
        else:
            counter[c] -= 1  # counter = {'a': 1, 'b': 1}
        
        # --- Iteration 2 ---
        # c = 'a'
        if c not in counter:  # Is 'a' not in counter? False
            return False
        elif counter[c] == 1:  # Is counter['a'] == 1? Yes!
            del counter[c]  # counter = {'b': 1}
        else:
            counter[c] -= 1

    return True  # Successfully constructed!
```
```python
Step 1: Initial State
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
prevMap = {}

Step 2: After First Iteration
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
prevMap = {2: 0}
diff = 7

Step 3: During Second Iteration
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
prevMap = {2: 0}
diff = 2  ‚Üê Found in prevMap!
i = 1

Final Output: [0, 1]
```

## Notes:
1. Things to keep in mind:
    - Cant solve the problem using the jewels method
    - Each letter in the magazine can only be used once
    - Build a counter like a telle counter to see if we can build a ransomNote with magazine letters

2.
