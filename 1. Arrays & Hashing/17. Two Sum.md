# [1. Two Sum Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## **Example 1:**

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

## **Example 2:**

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

## **Example 3:**

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## **Constraints:**

    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.

## Solution
```python

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]

        # Stores previously seen numbers and their indices
        prevMap = {}

        # Efficiently get both index and value
        for i, num in enumrate(nums):

            diff = target - num  # Check if complement exists

            if diff in prevMap: # Return solution if found

                return [prevMap[diff], i]
            
            prevMap[num] = i # Add current number to HashMap

        # Time: O(n)
        # Space: O(n)

```
## **Visualization**
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Initial state:
    # nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    # target = 9
    prevMap = {}  # Initialize empty HashMap
    
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        # --- Iteration 1 ---
        # i = 0, n = 2
        # prevMap = {}
        diff = target - n  # diff = 9 - 2 = 7
        if diff in prevMap:  # Check if 7 in prevMap: False
            return [prevMap[diff], i]
        prevMap[n] = i  # Add 2: prevMap = {2: 0}
        
        # --- Iteration 2 ---
        # i = 1, n = 7
        # prevMap = {2: 0}
        diff = target - n  # diff = 9 - 7 = 2
        if diff in prevMap:  # Check if 2 in prevMap: True!
            return [prevMap[2], 1]  # return [0, 1]
        # Function returns here, remaining iterations never execute
        
        # (For completeness, here's what would happen if we continued)
        # --- Iteration 3 ---
        # i = 2, n = 11
        # prevMap = {2: 0, 7: 1}
        diff = target - n  # diff = 9 - 11 = -2
        if diff in prevMap:  # Check if -2 in prevMap: False
        prevMap[n] = i  # Add 11: prevMap = {2: 0, 7: 1, 11: 2}
        
        # --- Iteration 4 ---
        # i = 3, n = 15
        # prevMap = {2: 0, 7: 1, 11: 2}
        diff = target - n  # diff = 9 - 15 = -6
        if diff in prevMap:  # Check if -6 in prevMap: False
        prevMap[n] = i  # Add 15: prevMap = {2: 0, 7: 1, 11: 2, 15: 3}

    return []  # Never reaches this line due to guaranteed solution
```

```python
Visual Memory State Trace:

Step 1: Initial State
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
prevMap = {}

Step 2: After First Iteration
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
prevMap = {2: 0}
diff = 7

Step 3: During Second Iteration
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
prevMap = {2: 0}
diff = 2  ‚Üê Found in prevMap!
i = 1

Final Output: [0, 1]
```
## Notes

1. Clever one-pass technique:
    - Use HashMap to store {value: index} pairs
    - Don't populate HashMap upfront
    - First check if complement exists
    - Then add current number to HashMap
    - This naturally prevents using same element twice

2. Why One-Pass Works:
    - For any solution pair (a,b):
        - When we reach the second number
        - The first number is guaranteed to be in HashMap
        - Because we add each number after checking
