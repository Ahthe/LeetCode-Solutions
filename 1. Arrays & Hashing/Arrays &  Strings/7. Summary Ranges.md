# [228. Summary Ranges Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/description/)

You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.

A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.

Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:

    "a->b" if a != b
    "a" if a == b

## **Example 1:**

Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"

## **Example 2:**

Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"

 
## **Constraints:**

    0 <= nums.length <= 20
    -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
    All the values of nums are unique.
    nums is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def summaryRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[str]:

        ans = []
        i = 0

        while i < len(nums):

            start = nums[i]

            while i < len(nums) - 1 and nums[i] + 1 == nums[i + 1]:
                i += 1

            if start  != nums[i]:
                ans.append(str(start) + '->' + str(nums[i]))
            else:
                ans.append(str(nums[i]))
            
            i += 1

        return ans

        # Time : O(n)
        # Space: O(n)
```

## **Visualization**

```python
from typing import List

nums = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7]

class Solution:
    def summaryRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        ans = []    # List to store result ranges as strings
        i = 0       # Initialize pointer `i` to start from the first element

        # Loop through `nums` until we reach the end
        while i < len(nums):
            # Mark the start of a new range
            start = nums[i]  

            # Find the end of the current range (consecutive numbers sequence)
            while i < len(nums) - 1 and nums[i] + 1 == nums[i + 1]: 
                i += 1  # Increment `i` if the next number is consecutive

            # If start of range differs from the end (`nums[i]`), form a range
            if start != nums[i]:
                ans.append(f"{start}->{nums[i]}")  # e.g., "0->2"
            else:
                ans.append(str(nums[i]))  # Single number case

            # Move to the next potential range start
            i += 1

        return ans

# Example Walkthrough
# Input: nums = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7]
# Output: ["0->2", "4->5", "7"]

# Execution:
# Initial i = 0, ans = []
# 1st iteration: start = 0
#   Inner while loop: i=0 -> i=1 -> i=2 (nums[2] = 2 is the last in consecutive range)
#   Form range: "0->2", ans = ["0->2"]
# 2nd iteration: start = 4
#   Inner while loop: i=3 -> i=4 (nums[4] = 5 is the last in consecutive range)
#   Form range: "4->5", ans = ["0->2", "4->5"]
# 3rd iteration: start = 7
#   No consecutive range, so append "7"
# Final result: ["0->2", "4->5", "7"]
