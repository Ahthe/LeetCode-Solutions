 # [56. Merge Intervals (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

 

## **Example 1:**

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

## **Example 2:**

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

## **Constraints:**

    1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
    intervals[i].length == 2
    0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        # sorting the interval pairs by the first pair in the array
        intervals.sort(key = lambda i: i[0])
        
        # to avoid an edge case
        merged_intervals = [intervals[0]]


        # we are already have interval[0] in merge, so we need to start from interval[1] position
        for start, end in intervals[1:]:

            # Check if the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in merged_intervals
            if merged_intervals[-1][1] < start:
                # If it does not overlap, add the current interval to merged_intervals
                merged_intervals.append([start, end])

            else:
                # If it does overlap, merge the current interval with the last one by
                # updating the end time of the last interval to the maximum end time seen so far
                merged_intervals[-1][1] = max(merged_intervals[-1][1], end)
        
        return merged_intervals 

        # Time: O n log n
        # Space: O(n)
```
## **Visualization**
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Sort intervals by their start times
        intervals.sort(key=lambda i: i[0])

        # Initialize merged_intervals with the first interval to avoid edge cases
        merged_intervals = [intervals[0]]

        # Sample input example
        # intervals = [[1,4], [2,3], [5,7], [6,8], [10,10]]
        # After sorting: intervals = [[1,4], [2,3], [5,7], [6,8], [10,10]]
        
        # Iterate through each interval starting from the second
        for start, end in intervals[1:]:
            # Current interval in the loop
            # Step-by-step for each interval:
            # 1st iteration: start = 2, end = 3
            # 2nd iteration: start = 5, end = 7
            # 3rd iteration: start = 6, end = 8
            # 4th iteration: start = 10, end = 10

            # Check if there's overlap with the last interval in merged_intervals
            if merged_intervals[-1][1] < start:
                # If no overlap, add the current interval
                # e.g., when we process [5,7] after merging [1,4] and [2,3]
                merged_intervals.append([start, end])
            else:
                # Overlapping case: merge by updating the end time to the maximum end
                # 1st iteration: merged_intervals[-1] = [1,4] and interval = [2,3]
                #  -> Merge: max(4,3) keeps end as 4, so merged_intervals[-1] = [1,4]
                # 2nd iteration: no change as 5 > merged_intervals[-1][1] = 4
                # 3rd iteration: overlapping intervals [5,7] and [6,8], merge to [5,8]
                # 4th iteration: single interval [10,10], no change needed
                merged_intervals[-1][1] = max(merged_intervals[-1][1], end)
        
        return merged_intervals

# Expected output: [[1, 4], [5, 8], [10, 10]]
```

## Notes:
1. [Algo Monster Explanation](https://algo.monster/liteproblems/56)
2. If the start time s of the current interval is greater than the end time of the last interval in ans, it means there is no overlap and we can simply add this interval to ans.
3. Why Start with the first interval ? 
   - Assigning merged_intervals = [intervals[0]] is essential because it initializes the merged list and allows the code to merge starting from the second interval. This avoids an edge case where if intervals has only one interval, itâ€™s already returned without further checks.
4. Non-overlapping check ? 
    - In the for loop, merged_intervals[-1][1] < start verifies if the current interval ([start, end]) doesn't overlap with the last merged interval. This helps prevent incorrect merges.
5. Updating the end of overlapping intervals: 
    - If the intervals overlap, merged_intervals[-1][1] = max(merged_intervals[-1][1], end) ensures the merged interval's end is extended to cover both intervals. This handles cases like overlapping at different points (e.g., [1, 3] and [2, 6] merge into [1, 6]).
