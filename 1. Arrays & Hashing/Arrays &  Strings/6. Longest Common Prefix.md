# [14. Longest Common Prefix Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/description/)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

## **Example 1:**

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

## **Example 2:**

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

 
## **Constraints:**

    1 <= strs.length <= 200
    0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
    strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:

        min_length = float('inf')

        for s in strs:
            if len(s) < min_length:
                min_length = len(s)
        
        i = 0
        while i < min_length:

            for s in strs:

                if s[i] != strs[0][i]:
                    return s[:i]
            
            i += 1
        
        return s[:i]


```

## **Visualization**
```python
strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]

class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:

        # Step 1: Determine the shortest string length in `strs` as a limit for prefix length.
        min_length = float('inf')  # Set initially to infinity to easily find the smallest length.

        # Iterate over each string to find the minimum length.
        for s in strs:
            if len(s) < min_length:
                min_length = len(s)  # Update `min_length` to the smallest string length found.
        
        # Example:
        # min_length = 4 (from "flow")

        # Step 2: Use `i` to track each character position we are comparing across strings.
        i = 0

        # Step 3: Iterate over each character index up to `min_length`.
        while i < min_length:
            
            # Check if the character at position `i` in each string is the same.
            for s in strs:
                # If any character at index `i` is different, return the common prefix up to this point.
                if s[i] != strs[0][i]:
                    return s[:i]  # Return prefix up to `i` if mismatch occurs.

            # Increment `i` to continue checking the next character position.
            i += 1

        # If no mismatches were found, return the prefix of length `i` from any string.
        return s[:i]

# Example Execution:
# With strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]:
# Iteration 1 (i=0): 'f' matches in all => continue
# Iteration 2 (i=1): 'l' matches in all => continue
# Iteration 3 (i=2): 'o' in "flower" and "flow" != 'i' in "flight" => return "fl"
