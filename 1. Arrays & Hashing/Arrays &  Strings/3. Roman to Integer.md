# [13. Roman to Integer (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

## **Example 1:**

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

## **Example 2:**

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

## **Example 3:**

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 15
    s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
    It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

## Solution

```python
class Solution
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:

        
        roman = {'I' : 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
                
        i = 0
        summ = 0
        n = len(s)

        while i < n:

            if i < n - 1 and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]:
                summ += roman[s[i+1]] - roman[s[i]]
                i += 2
            else:
                summ += roman[s[i]]
                i += 1
        
        return summ
```

## **Visualization**

```python
s = "IX"

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # Dictionary for Roman numeral values
        roman = {'I' : 1, 'V' : 5, 'X' : 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}

        summ = 0         # Initialize result
                        # summ = 0

        n = len(s)      # Length of the string s
                        # n = 2

        i = 0           # Initialize index
                        # i = 0

        # Loop through the characters in s
        while i < n:
            # Check if next character represents a larger value than current
            if i < n - 1 and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i + 1]]:
                summ += roman[s[i + 1]] - roman[s[i]]  # Perform subtraction
                # summ = 9 (X - I)

                i += 2  # Move index by 2 (since we used two characters)
                # i = 2
            else:
                # Otherwise, add current value to result
                summ += roman[s[i]]
                i += 1

        # Return the final result
        return summ    # Output: 9
```

## Notes

1. Loop through s with while: We use a while loop instead of for, giving us more control over i when skipping characters.
2. This is why we check if roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]: it identifies cases where a smaller numeral is followed by a larger one, indicating subtraction.

3. Accessing the Next Element in a 
    - String/Array:
        - s[i+1]: Accesses the next element (if within bounds).
        - s[(i+1) % len(s)]: Wraps around for circular arrays.

    -  Dictionary Values:
        - roman[s[i]]: Retrieves value for s[i].
        
        - list(roman.keys())[i+1]: Access the next key manually.
    
    - Do not do this roman[s[i] + 1] wrong syntax

        - roman[s[i]] + 1 is correct if you want to add 1 to the value of the Roman numeral at s[i].
    
        - roman[s[i] + 1] is incorrect because it tries to use a number as a key instead of a character.


4. Why Summ += ... ?
    - Cumulative Sum: summ += ... adds the current numeral's value to the existing sum, rather than resetting summ to just the latest value.
    - Handling Multiple Numerals: Roman numerals are represented by multiple characters (e.g., "XIV"), so we need to keep adding each numeral’s value to get the total   integer representation.
    - Using summ = ... would only set summ to the latest value each time, resulting in the last numeral’s value only, rather than a total sum.

5. Why while instead of for:

    - while loop: Gives control over the index (e.g., i += 2), useful for skipping elements or custom increments.
    for loop: Automatically updates the index based on the range or sequence (e.g., range(len(s))).

6. About the i Variable:

    - Manual update in for: Updating i inside a for loop only affects the current iteration; i will be reset on the next loop cycle. Control with while: while loop allows full control over i, enabling conditional updates during iteration.
