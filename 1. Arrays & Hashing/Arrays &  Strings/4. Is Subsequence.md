# [392. Is Subsequence (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

## **Example 1:**

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

## **Example 2:**

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

 
Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 100
    0 <= t.length <= 104
    s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

 
Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 10^9, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution
```python
s = "abc"
t = "ahbgdc"

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        S = len(s)       # Length of string s
                          # S = 3

        T = len(t)       # Length of string t
                        # T = 6

        j = 0            # Initialize pointer for s
                        # j = 0

        # Quick checks for special cases
        if s == '': return True   # If s is empty, return True
        if S > T: return False    # If s is longer than t, return False

        # Loop through each character in t
        for i in range(T):         # i iterates over t's indices (0 to 5)
            if t[i] == s[j]:       # If characters match
                if j == S - 1:     # Check if all characters in s are matched
                    return True    # If matched, return True
                j += 1             # Move to next character in s

        # If loop completes without finding all chars of s in t in order
        return False               # Output: True
```

 ## **Visualizations**
```python
s = "abc"
t = "ahbgdc"

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        S = len(s)         # S = 3 (length of "abc")
        T = len(t)         # T = 6 (length of "ahbgdc")

        j = 0              # Initialize pointer for s
                           # j = 0

        # Check for quick special cases
        if s == '': return True   # Not true here
        if S > T : return False   # Not true here

        # Loop through each character in t
        for i in range(T):            # Loop i through range of T (0 to 5)
            if t[i] == s[j]:          

                # 1st iteration (i = 0): t[0] is 'a', s[0] is 'a' (match)
                # Move to next character in s
                j = 1            

                # 2nd iteration (i = 1): t[1] is 'h', s[1] is 'b' (no match)
                
                # 3rd iteration (i = 2): t[2] is 'b', s[1] is 'b' (match)
                j = 2            

                # 4th iteration (i = 3): t[3] is 'g', s[2] is 'c' (no match)

                # 5th iteration (i = 4): t[4] is 'd', s[2] is 'c' (no match)

                # 6th iteration (i = 5): t[5] is 'c', s[2] is 'c' (match)
                # j = S - 1 (final character matched), return True

        # If the loop completes and not all characters are matched, return False
        return False     # Output: True if subsequence, else False
```

# Notes
- 1. s subsequence of t
    - check if s is '' & check if len(s) should not be greater than len(t)
    - for loop i to iterate len(t)
    - if t[i] == s[j]: if j == S-1: return true,all characters in s are matched
    - Return True if matched, else False

- 2. s[j] refers to the character at index j in s, not the index itself.

- 3. DO NOT!! J == S moves past the last index of s, would result in IndexError because j would be trying to access an index that doesn't exist in s.
