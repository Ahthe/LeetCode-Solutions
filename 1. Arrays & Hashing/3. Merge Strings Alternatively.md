# [1768. Merge Strings Alternately (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 
## **Example 1:**

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

## **Example 2:**

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

## **Example 3:**

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

Constraints:

    1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
    word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```python

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:

        i, j = 0, 0

        res = []

        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):

            res.append(word1[i])
            res.append(word2[j])

            i += 1
            j += 1

        res.append(word1[i:])
        res.append(word2[j:])

        return "".join(res)

```

## **Visualization**


Time Complexity:  O (A + B)
Space Complexity: O (A + B)

```python

word1 = "abc"
word2 = "xyz"

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        i, j = 0, 0     # Initialize pointers for each word
                        # i = 0, j = 0

        res = []        # Initialize an empty list to store the result

        # While both pointers are within the word lengths
        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):
            res.append(word1[i])     # Add word1's character at i to res
            # res = ["a"]

            res.append(word2[j])     # Add word2's character at j to res
            # res = ["a", "x"]

            i += 1      # Move pointer i to the next character in word1
            # i = 1

            j += 1      # Move pointer j to the next character in word2
            # j = 1

        # Continue looping:
        # res after 2nd loop = ["a", "x", "b", "y"]
        # res after 3rd loop = ["a", "x", "b", "y", "c", "z"]

        # Add remaining characters from each word, if any:
        res.append(word1[i:])    # word1[i:] = ""
        res.append(word2[j:])    # word2[j:] = ""

        # Join list into final result string
        return "".join(res)      # Output: "axbycz"
```
## Notes
1. Remember you cant compare and int variable to a string while i < word1 embrassing!!! need to compare it with the len(word1)
