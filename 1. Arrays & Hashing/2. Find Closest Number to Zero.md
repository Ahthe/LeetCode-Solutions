# 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero (Easy)

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 1000
    -105 <= nums[i] <= 105



```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize 'closest' with the first element in nums.
        # We assume the array is non-empty based on constraints.
        closest = nums[0]

        # Iterate through each number in the list
        for num in nums: 
            # If the absolute value of 'num' is smaller than the absolute value of 'closest',
            # update 'closest' to 'num', as it is closer to zero.
            if abs(num) < abs(closest):
                closest = num
        
        # If 'closest' is negative and its positive counterpart exists in nums,
        # return the positive counterpart to satisfy the condition of preferring positive.
        if closest < 0 and abs(closest) in nums: 
            return abs(closest)
        else:
            return closest

        # Time Complexity: O(n), as we loop through the entire list once.
        # Space Complexity: O(1), as we only store a single variable, 'closest'.
```

## **Visualization**


```python
nums = [2, -1, -3, 3, 1]

class Solution:
    def findClosestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        closest = nums[0]  # closest = 2 (initialize with first element)

        # Start iterating over nums: (2, -1, -3, 3)
        for num in nums:
            # Iteration 1: num = 2
            # abs(num) = 2, abs(closest) = 2; no change in closest
            if abs(num) < abs(closest):  # Condition not met
                closest = num  # closest remains 2

            # Iteration 2: num = -1
            # abs(num) = 1, abs(closest) = 2; update closest to -1
            if abs(num) < abs(closest):
                closest = num  # closest = -1

            # Iteration 3: num = -3
            # abs(num) = 3, abs(closest) = 1; no change in closest
            if abs(num) < abs(closest):  # Condition not met
                closest = num  # closest remains -1

            # Iteration 4: num = 3
            # abs(num) = 3, abs(closest) = 1; no change in closest
            if abs(num) < abs(closest):  # Condition not met
                closest = num  # closest remains -1
            
            # Iteration 5: num = 1
            # abs(num) = 1, abs(closest) = 1; no change in closest
            if abs(num) < abs(closest):  # Condition not met
                closest = num  # closest remains -1

        # After loop, closest = -1
        # Final check: if closest is negative and its positive counterpart exists in nums
        if closest < 0 and abs(closest) in nums:  #  Yes it is negative (-1) has a positive counterpart in nums
            return abs(closest)  # Does apply here, so goes to next line, we return the larger value which is 1

        return closest  # Returns 1
```
