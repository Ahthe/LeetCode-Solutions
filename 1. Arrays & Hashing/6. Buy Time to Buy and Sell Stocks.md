# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Easy)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

## **Example 1:**

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

## **Example 2:**

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

 
## **Constraints:**

    1 <= prices.length <= 105
    0 <= prices[i] <= 104

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        lowest = prices[0]
        maxProfit = 0

        for price in prices:

            if price < lowest:
                
                lowest = price
            
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - lowest)
        
        return maxProfit

```

## **Visualization**
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        lowest = prices[0]  # lowest = 7 (initial lowest price)
        maxProfit = 0       # maxProfit = 0 (initial maximum profit)

        # Loop through each price in the list
        for price in prices:       

            # 1st iteration (price = 7): 
            # if 7 < 7 (false), skip to maxProfit calculation
            maxProfit = max(0, 7 - 7)   # maxProfit = 0

            # 2nd iteration (price = 1):
            # if 1 < 7 (true), update lowest price to 1
            lowest = 1
            maxProfit = max(0, 1 - 1)   # maxProfit = 0

            # 3rd iteration (price = 5):
            # if 5 < 1 (false), skip to maxProfit calculation
            maxProfit = max(0, 5 - 1)   # maxProfit = 4

            # 4th iteration (price = 3):
            # if 3 < 1 (false), skip to maxProfit calculation
            maxProfit = max(4, 3 - 1)   # maxProfit = 4

            # 5th iteration (price = 6):
            # if 6 < 1 (false), skip to maxProfit calculation
            maxProfit = max(4, 6 - 1)   # maxProfit = 5

            # 6th iteration (price = 4):
            # if 4 < 1 (false), skip to maxProfit calculation
            maxProfit = max(5, 4 - 1)   # maxProfit = 5

        # After loop, the maximum profit is determined
        return maxProfit      # Output: 5
```
