# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        # Final results: will store all subsets
        res = []

        # Current subset we're building
        sol = []

        # dfs helper func to backtracking
        def backtrack(i):

            if i >= len(nums) # if i goes out of bounds
                res.append(sol[:]) # copy sol into res
                return
            
            # Choice 1: Numbers we dont want to pickup
            backtrack(i + 1)

            # Choice 2: Include current number
            sol.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i + 1)
            sol.pop()
        
        backtrack(0) # Start with index 0
        return res
```

## Notes
- The hint that backtracking is needed:
    - Need to generate ALL possible combinations
    - Each element has binary choice (include/exclude)
    - Need to track state and undo choices
