# Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:

        def has_sum(root, summ):

            if not root: # Base case
                return False
            
            summ += root.val # Add the current root's value to the running summ

            # if its a leaf root which doesnt have left or right root,
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                return summ == targetSum # check trutiy if current running sum is equal target
            
            # If we did not hit the leaf root, Recursively check left and right subtrees
            # It also keeps adding the values to the summ
            return has_sum(root.left, summ) or has_sum(root.right, summ)

        # Start the recursion with the root node and initial sum of 0
        return has_sum(root, 0)

        # Time: O(n)
        # Space: O(h)

```

## Notes:

- If we hit the leaf root which doesnt have left or right root, and summ is not equal to target we return False
```py
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return summ == targetSum # check trutiy or falsly
```
